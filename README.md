# IBM Watson Online Sentiment Analyser

This repo contains the code for a simple online sentiment analyser built with React. The project uses IBM Watson Sentiment Analyser to analyse the sentiment and/or emotion from the user input, and is hosted on the IBM Cloud as a Cloud Foundry application.

The user can submit text or provide an url for analysis, and choose between sentiment or emotion analysis. The input has to be more than ~30 characters in order for IBM Watson to be able to analyse it.
